# Camp Scoreboard — CLAUDE.md

## What this is

A static, vanilla JS/HTML/CSS web app (no build step, no framework, no
`package.json`) that runs camp game scoring for a week-long kids' camp.
Deployed via GitHub Pages at **camp.patricksimpson.info**. Every game and
schedule detail is hardcoded into `app.js` — there's no backend beyond an
optional Firebase Realtime Database used purely for cross-device sync.

Files: `index.html` (page shell), `app.js` (all logic + game/schedule
data, ~2200 lines), `styles.css`, `firebase-config.js` (sync config),
`CNAME` (custom domain).

## Deployment: push directly to `main`, no PR

**`main` is the live branch.** GitHub Pages serves camp.patricksimpson.info
from it. There is no CI, no build step, and no staging environment — a
push to `main` **is** the deploy. When asked to fix or change something on
this site, commit and push straight to `main`. Don't create a feature
branch and leave the fix sitting in a PR — during camp week, an undeployed
fix is functionally the same as no fix, and that exact mistake already
happened once (see "History" below).

**Before considering any change actually deployed**, verify it's live —
don't just push and assume:
```
curl -s https://camp.patricksimpson.info/app.js | grep -c '<something unique to your change>'
curl -s https://camp.patricksimpson.info/index.html | grep -E 'app\.js\?v=|styles\.css\?v='
```
If the live site doesn't reflect your push, GitHub Pages' source branch may
not actually be `main` (Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Branch)
— check that before assuming the deploy failed for some other reason.

**Every time `app.js`, `index.html`, or `styles.css` changes:**
1. Bump the `?v=N` cache-busting query string for every changed asset in
   `index.html` (there are three: `styles.css`, `firebase-config.js`,
   `app.js` — keep them in sync, all bumped together).
2. Update `CODE_UPDATED_AT` near the top of `app.js` to the current UTC
   time (`date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ`) — this drives the "Code last
   updated" line in the page footer. There's no build pipeline to stamp
   this automatically, so it's a manual step, easy to forget.
3. `node --check app.js` before committing — cheap syntax safety net for a
   single 2000+ line file with no test suite.

## Firebase Realtime Database gotcha (already bit us once)

Realtime Database **silently drops empty arrays, empty objects, and
`null` values on write** — there's no way to represent "present but
empty." Any piece of synced state (`SYNC_KEYS` in `app.js`) that can
legitimately be empty at some point (e.g. a freshly-created bracket with
`matches: []`) can come back from a remote round-trip missing those keys
entirely. A render function that assumes `.length` or `.map` will always
work on those fields will throw.

The fix pattern already in place (`normalizeBracket` in `app.js`): after
loading from `localStorage`, after every remote merge in `initSync`, and
right before a render function reads a synced object, coerce missing
array/object fields back to safe defaults in place. Follow this same
pattern for any new synced, potentially-empty data shape — don't assume
"it was an empty array when I wrote it, so it'll still be one when I read
it back."

## Footer timestamps

- **"Code last updated"** — `CODE_UPDATED_AT` constant in `app.js`,
  manually bumped (see deploy steps above).
- **"Data last updated"** — `state.meta.lastDataChangeAt`, stamped by
  `touchData()` at points that represent real scoreboard activity (a game
  result saved, a bracket match recorded, a team renamed). Deliberately
  NOT stamped by view-only actions (switching day tabs, dark mode, PIN
  unlock) so it reflects actual camp activity, not page traffic. Synced
  across devices like the rest of state. If you add a new way to record
  real data, call `touchData()` there too.

Both timestamps render in camp time (`America/New_York`, formatted via
`formatEasternStamp`), matching the "Happening Now" schedule banner's
convention — never device-local time.

## History / why these rules exist

- A bracket-format bug (blank screen after "Start Bracket") was fixed and
  pushed to a feature branch, but a PR had already merged an earlier
  commit into the live branch — the fix itself sat unmerged while the bug
  kept reproducing live, mid-camp. Hence: push straight to `main`, and
  verify against the live URL before calling anything fixed.
- The repo's live branch used to be named `claude/festive-bohr-Wt6Np` (the
  actual default branch GitHub Pages served from), while a separate,
  long-stale branch literally named `main` pointed at an old, unrelated
  domain (`tripplanner.doofus.live`). Both have since been reconciled:
  `main` now mirrors what was live, and the old stale `main` is preserved
  at `archive/main-tripplanner-old-2026-07-19` in case anything from it is
  ever needed. If `main` doesn't seem to control deployment, check that
  the GitHub repo's default branch and Pages source are actually set to
  `main` in Settings — that manual flip may still be pending.
